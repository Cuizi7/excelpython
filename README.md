# ExcelPython

A lightweight, open source interface for calling Python from Excel

### Description

ExcelPython is a lightweight, easily distributable library for interfacing Excel and Python. It enables easy access to Python scripts from Excel VBA, allowing you to substitute VBA with Python for complex automation tasks which would be facilitated by Python's extensive standard library.

### Installation and troubleshooting

Installer packages can be downloaded from the **releases** section.  Please note that the 64-bit installer is to be used only with 64-bit Office, note that many 64-bit Windows PCs actually have 32-bit Office installed.

### Help and documentation

The **wiki** contains a tutorial to help you get started as well as links to other resources.

If you don't find your answer, need more help, find a bug, think of a useful new feature, or just want to give some feedback by letting me and everyone else know what you're doing with ExcelPython, please create an **issue** ticket!
