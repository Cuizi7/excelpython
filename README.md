# ExcelPython

A lightweight, open source interface for calling Python from Excel


### Description

ExcelPython is a lightweight, easily distributable library for interfacing Excel and Python. It enables easy access to Python scripts from Excel VBA, allowing you to substitute VBA with Python for complex automation tasks which would be facilitated by Python's extensive standard library.

### Installation and troubleshooting

Installer packages can be downloaded from GitHub's 'releases' section.  Please note that the 64-bit installer is to be used only with 64-bit *Office*, note that many 64-bit PCs actually have 32-bit Office installed.

### Help and documentation

There is a tutorial on how to use ExcelPython in the wiki as well as links to other resources.

If you don't find your answer, need more help, find a bug, think of a useful new feature, or just want to say how much you love Excel and anything to do with it, please create an issue ticket!
