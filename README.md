# ExcelPython

A lightweight, open source interface for calling Python from Excel


### Description

ExcelPython is a lightweight, easily distributable library for interfacing Excel and Python. It enables easy access to Python scripts from Excel VBA, allowing you to substitute VBA with Python for complex automation tasks which would be facilitated by Python's extensive standard library.

### Installation and troubleshooting

The 64-bit installer is to be used only with 64-bit Office, note that many 64-bit PCs actually have 32-bit Office installed.
