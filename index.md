box_title: Why ExcelPython is awesome
box: |
    * **Easy deployment**: Just zip up your ExcelPython-powered workbook folder and distribute! No messing around with installing add-ins or registering COM servers on the end-user's machine.
    * **Compatible**: Works with most combinations of Excel and Python - you can even mix 32 and 64 bits. Plays well with [xlwings]!
    * **Flexible**: Target specific a Python installation or runtime environment for your workbook.
    * **High performance**: The Python runtime only gets loaded once the first time you call into Python code, which means the successive calls are not slowed down by heavy library imports.
    * **Powerful**: Access the entire Excel COM object model from Python.
    * **Free and open-source**: ExcelPython is released under a permissive [MIT license][].
